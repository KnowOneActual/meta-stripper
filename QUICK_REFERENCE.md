# Quick Reference Guide: Document Metadata Removal

## 🚨 Why This Matters

**Every document you share contains hidden metadata that can expose:**
- Employee names and email addresses
- Internal file paths and network structure
- Software versions (security vulnerability information)
- Edit history and deleted content
- Company organizational details
- Confidential comments and tracked changes

**Bottom line:** Sharing documents without removing metadata is a privacy and security risk.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install meta-stripper
git clone https://github.com/KnowOneActual/meta-stripper.git
cd meta-stripper
pip install -e .

# Strip metadata from a file
metastripper document.pdf

# Check metadata before removing
metastripper --show document.pdf
```

---

## 📋 Common Use Cases

### Before Sending to Clients
```bash
metastripper contract.pdf proposal.docx specs.pdf
```

### Before Publishing Online
```bash
metastripper press_release.pdf whitepaper.docx
```

### Check What's Inside First
```bash
metastripper --show sensitive_document.pdf
```

### Specify Output Name
```bash
metastripper internal_report.pdf -o client_report.pdf
```

### Process All PDFs in Directory
```bash
metastripper *.pdf
```

## 🎯 When to Remove Metadata

✅ **ALWAYS remove metadata before:**
- Sending documents to clients or vendors
- Publishing files on your website
- Submitting materials in legal proceedings
- Sharing with external contractors
- Posting to social media or press releases
- Responding to FOIA/public records requests
- Uploading to cloud services
- Email attachments to external parties

❌ **Keep metadata for:**
- Internal documents and collaboration
- Version control and document management
- Audit trails and compliance records
- Documents that never leave your organization

---

## 🔍 What Gets Removed

### PDF Files
- Author, Creator, Producer
- Title, Subject, Keywords
- Creation and modification dates
- Custom metadata fields
- Software version information

### DOCX Files
- Author and company name
- Document template information
- Total editing time
- Revision count
- Manager and category fields
- Custom properties
- Extended properties (application details)

---

## ⚠️ What Does NOT Get Removed

- Visible text and images
- Document formatting and layout
- Embedded fonts and styles
- Watermarks (visible or invisible)
- Steganographic data
- Digital signatures (these will be invalidated)

**Important:** Always review document content separately. Metadata removal doesn't redact visible information.

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

Before sharing any document externally:

- [ ] Remove metadata using meta-stripper
- [ ] Review visible content for sensitive information
- [ ] Check file naming for confidential details
- [ ] Verify tracked changes are accepted/rejected
- [ ] Ensure comments are deleted
- [ ] Confirm hidden text is removed
- [ ] Test output file to ensure functionality

## 📊 Risk Examples by Industry

| Industry | Risk | Metadata Exposure |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| **Legal** | Client confidentiality | Attorney names, billing hours, edit history |
| **Healthcare** | HIPAA violations | Patient info in author fields, PHI in comments |
| **Media** | Unreleased content | Project names, production schedules, plot details |
| **Finance** | Competitive intel | Client names, deal terms, analyst notes |
| **Government** | FOIA compliance | Policy deliberations, interagency coordination |
| **Technology** | IP protection | Feature roadmaps, source code references |

## 🔧 Command Reference

```bash
# Basic usage
metastripper <file>                    # Strip metadata, create new file
metastripper file1.pdf file2.docx      # Process multiple files
metastripper *.pdf                     # Process all PDFs (bash)

# Options
metastripper -o output.pdf input.pdf   # Specify output name
metastripper --show document.pdf       # Display metadata only
metastripper -v document.pdf           # Verbose output
metastripper --version                 # Show version
metastripper -h                        # Show help
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Make It a Workflow Step
Add metadata removal as a standard step before external sharing

### 2. Keep Original Files
Meta-stripper creates new files automatically. Keep originals for internal use.

### 3. Use Descriptive Output Names
```bash
metastripper internal_v5.pdf -o client_final.pdf
```

### 4. Verify Before Sending
```bash
metastripper --show cleaned_document.pdf
```

### 5. Batch Process Project Folders
```bash
cd project_deliverables/
metastripper *.pdf *.docx
```

### 6. Train Your Team
Ensure everyone understands metadata risks and knows how to use the tool

## 🚀 Quick Decision Tree

```
Are you sharing this document externally?
├─ NO  → Keep metadata (internal use only)
└─ YES → Does it contain sensitive work?
    ├─ NO  → Still strip metadata (defense in depth)
    └─ YES → ALWAYS strip metadata
             ↓
             metastripper document.pdf
             ↓
             Verify output
             ↓
             Share cleaned version
```
